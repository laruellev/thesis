# thesis
All of the files and script used to generate the data presented in my thesis are in this repository. 

The thesis is titled "Marketing incentives for Green Technologies" and is conducted for the MScBA in Business Analytics & Management for the academic year 2023-2024. The associated university is the Erasmus University Rotterdam, with Dr Roos as thesis supervisor and Dr Gabel as co-reader. 

I am well aware that there is a large margin for improvements in terms of readability, efficiency and style of the R scripts. I invite you to read them along the thesis to have a clearer picture of what they do. 

Best,
Valentine Laruelle
